            <p class="lead">
              At Disability Connect Australia, our vision is to lead the way in creating an
              accessible and inclusive society where everyone, regardless of their abilities, is
              empowered to thrive. We envision a world where accessibility is at the forefront of
              every decision, action, and policy.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
              We are committed to dismantling barriers, fostering equal opportunities, and ensuring
              that individuals with diverse abilities have the support, tools, and resources they
              need to live fully and independently. Through collaboration with communities,
              organizations, and policy-makers, we aim to be a catalyst for meaningful change in
              both the built environment and society at large.
            </p>
